<p> My girlfriend Kelly and I recently returned from a little European adventure. It was supposed to start with a flight out of Boston to Barcelona, Spain. However, due to a little passport snafu, we ended up spending some 24 hours more in Boston -- mostly in the passport agency. Luckily though, I was able to get a same day passport at the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/requirements/where-to-apply/passport-agencies/boston.html">Boston Passport Agency</a>. I've never had much of anything good to say about the process of getting a passport, but they people here were truly incredibly nice, understanding and helped save our trip when we really thought months of planning (and savings) was lost. Some 6 hours after first walking in, I walked out with a new passport.</p>

<p>Of course, at this point we had long missed our original flight, so we scoured the interweb for any way to get to Barcelona that wouldn't entirely break the bank. What we found was a same day $300 some odd dollar flight to Barcelona with a stop over in Bergen, Norway. The catch? I left out of Stewart Airport in New York, a very small airport about 1.5 hours outside NYC with no public transport to/from Boston where we were to fly back to 11 days later. We decided we'd figure out out later, drove the 3 hours there, left the car in long term parking and just about 24 hours after we were originally supposed to depart, we were on a plane headed to Europe</p>

<p>We made it to Bergen, no issues, and the view during the decent was enough to put Norway right near the top of my "To travel to" list.

<p>After a layover, we were back on a plane heading towards Barcelona. Our trip was back in sight and it already felt like ages since the Airline attendent said, "You are not going to be able to fly with this passport." Unfortunately, are late arrival to Barcelona meant we didn't have time to see the city. We raced across the city to the train station where we immediately hopped on a train. After some train delays, we arrived in Avignon, France. After a killer shower and epic sleep, we finally (re)started our adventure. Avignon is a small and beautiful town in the South of France. It is perfectly size such that it can be crossed by foot in about half an hour. This, however, does not mean there is little to see here. While we only had an evening and morning, I'm sure days could be spent exploring the perfectly French restaurants, cafes, and markets, as well as the stunning <i>Palais des Papes</i> and the famous <i>Pont Saint-Benezet</i> (or simply <i>Pont d'Avignon</i>).

<p>After running around the city, taking in all we could, we took a short train south to the much larger city of Marsellie, a port city of France located on the Mediterranean sea. Here we explored the <i>Basilique Notre-Dame de la Garde</i>, a beautiful pebble beach, the old forts of the city, the <i>Iles du Frioul</i> and many cafes with delicious croissants.<hr>
