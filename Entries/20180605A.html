<h1>The Trifecta (aka, the beach)</h1>

<p>I love the beach. And coasts in general. One of the neatest things about the coasts is their dynamicity. If you go to a beach one day and then a year later, it's unlikely it looks exactly the same. It may not even look the same from one day to the next if a strong storm hits. And this dynamic behavior is not limited to the visible section of the coast either. The shape of the bottom underneath the water can also also change continuously, something most surfers can attest to. A perfect sandbar won't be there forever</p>

<p> And it is not just the land that changes; the ocean, this astonishingly massive pool of salty water, is most times covered by a complex array of ripples which, to us, can appear as powerful, magnificent and even destructive waves. And where do the waves come from but the final piece of the trifecta; the air moving over the liquid creates these waves which may then travel for hundreds or even thousands of miles before crashing into a coast.</p>

<p> The coasts are the only places on earth where these three states of matter interact on such an immense scales. And while coasts may therefore receive the full furry of nature, they may also be one of the single most peaceful places to be. Almost everyone has walked up to a coastline at some point and just said, 'wow,' as most of their worries melt away. They are a place where, when nature turns her gentler side, we flock to for the sole purpose of being. Nowhere else do people come together and just sit in the glory of nature like they do on the coasts.</p>
