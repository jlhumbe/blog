        <h3><span class="w3-opacity">June 18, 2018:   </span> <b>Usurping Evolution</b></h3>
        <h5>Notes on the implications of understanding ourselves</h5>
      </div>
        <div class="w3-container">

    <p>It is an interesting point in time – at least for humans. We, collectively at a species, are the only known animal to have evolved in such a way that we have come to realize what biological evolution is and how it works. It may seem like a inconsequential and even philosophical consideration resulting from scientific inquiry, but to know how we came to be what we are may have some interesting implications. The strangeness of this knowledge, and what makes this such an interesting point in time for people, is that we are not limited to simply being aware of how evolution works. We can inspect it and asses it. Where evolution is limited to a single mind track – survive – we, though the processes of evolution, have come to a new era of awareness and prosperity. </p>  

    <p>Of course, a percentage of humans on this planet are not prospering. To many, the daily struggle for survival is all too real, and this is a genuine issue deserving of attention. As a whole though, our species is thriving. We have taken over the globe in such a way that no other animal poses any sort of threat to our species. We manipulate the earth to do as we will. We flattened it, plow it, and grow all the food we want, like no other animal ever has. We drain ancient pools of energy from deep underground to power machines that accelerate nearly all parts of our lives. We are gods, we think.</p>

    <p>But, also, we at times digress. For instance, if we have come to pick apart the very history that created us, mistake by mistake, why can we not yet command ourselves to discontinue the ongoing mistakes of evolution? One such mistake is our unwillingness to realize the commonality of our goals here on earth as humans, as people. In the great abundance of resources and knowledge we have gathered, why do we still fight over trivial matters? Why do some of us hoard food and goods for ourselves while others starve? </p>

    <p>We commit these mistakes and others because we have not yet come to fully believe in ourselves. We have obtained great power, but not yet accepted the responsibility that comes with it. Instead, we outsource the responsibility to good and evil, forces we believe to be innate and uncontrollable. Realistically though, is it not truly the lingering forces of evolution that prompt much that we believe to be evil? Good and evil, right and wrong – these things are recent creations that exist only within the minds of conscious beings. A weed in the earth may grow quickly, using up nutrients and quickly securing a spot in the sun before other plants have a chance to do the same, yet we know this behavior is an evolutionary tactic for survival, not greed. However, in our minds, we associate greed with poor morals, a characteristic we rarely link to evolution. </p>

    <p>People struggle, though, to realize the full potential of this new perspective we have been offered by our vast and growing understanding of the world around us. We have taken a step in the right direction, to (generally) label greed as a bad characteristic, but we rarely make a further and necessary connection; greed is an outdated evolutionary tactic for humans.</p>

    <p>In many ways, we continue to live like our only purpose is to survive, when really, survival is a given for most people in the developed world. We do not leave our houses in the morning thinking, ‘I hope I survive today.’ It’s a given. It is not, however, foolish or even wrong that evolution has left its mark on us. Evolution is a part of us. We are the products of it.</p>

    <p>But, we are now also something more. We are conscious in a new way, a way evolution never was. We can gather large sums of information, consider the past, present and future, and make informed decisions. And, because of this, we know world peace makes sense. We must therefore, actively, push back against evolution where it was wrong. We must say no to absurd behavior based on evolution. We must say yes to our great fortune we’ve been blessed with, our minds, and use it to create a new kind of evolution, one more aware and actively participating in the universe. </p>

      <h3><span class="w3-opacity">June 4, 2018:   </span> <b>Europe Trip: Days 1-3</b></h3>
      <h5>US (Kittery, ME to Boston, MA to Stewart Airport, New York), Norway, Spain and France. </h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
    <p> My girlfriend Kelly and I recently returned from a little European adventure. It was supposed to start with a flight out of Boston, MA heading directly to Barcelona, Spain. However... due to a little passport snafu, we ended up spending some 24 hours more in Boston -- much of it in a passport agency, but also some much more enjoyable time unexpectedly staying with our good and welcoming friend Adriana. While not exactly the first day of vacation I imagined, I was able to get a same day passport at the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/requirements/where-to-apply/passport-agencies/boston.html">Boston Passport Agency</a>. I've never had much of anything good to say about the process of getting a passport, but the people here were truly incredibly nice, understanding and helped save our trip when we really thought months of planning (and savings) was lost. Some 6 hours after first walking in, I walked out with a new passport.</p>

    <p>Of course, at this point we had long missed our original flight, so we scoured the interweb for any way to get to Barcelona that wouldn't entirely break the bank. What we found was a same day $300 some odd dollar flight to Barcelona with a stop over in Bergen, Norway. The catch? It left out of Stewart Airport in New York, a very small airport about 1.5 hours outside NYC, 3 hours drive from Boston and with no public transport to/from Boston where we were to fly back to 11 days later. We were somewhat desperate though and decided we'd figure out the whole car being in a different state thing later. We drove the 3 hours there, left the car in long term parking and just about 24 hours after we were originally supposed to depart, we were on a plain headed to Europe.</p>

    <p>We made it to our first stop, Bergen, Norway, with no issues and the view during the decent was enough to put Norway right near the top of my "To travel to" list.</p> <hr>

    <p>After a layover, we were back on a plane heading towards Barcelona. Our trip was back in sight and it already felt like ages since the Airline attendant said, "You are not going to be able to fly with this passport." Unfortunately, our late arrival to Barcelona meant we didn't have time to see the city. We raced across town to the train station where we immediately hopped on a train. After some train delays, pushing our total travel time up towards the 36 hour mark, we arrived in Avignon, France. After a killer shower and epic sleep, we finally (re)started our adventure. Avignon is a small and beautiful town in the South of France. It is perfectly sized such that it can be crossed by foot in about half an hour. This, however, does not mean there is little to see here. While we only had an evening and morning, I'm sure days could be spent exploring the perfectly French restaurants, cafes, and markets, as well as the stunning <i>Palais des Papes</i> and the famous <i>Pont Saint-Benezet</i> (or simply <i>Pont d'Avignon</i>).</p><hr>

    <p>After running around the city, taking in all we could, we took a short train south to the much larger city of Marsellie, a port city of France located on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. Here we explored the <i>Basilique Notre-Dame de la Garde</i>, a beautiful pebble beach, the old forts of the city, the <i>Iles du Frioul</i> and many cafes with delicious croissants.</p><hr>
