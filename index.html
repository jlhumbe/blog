        <h3><span class="w3-opacity">June 21, 2018:   </span> <b>Earth doesn't have a personality</b></h3>
        <h5>But it may seem like it and we need to be weary of what will happen when it 'loses its cool' </h5>
      </div>
        <div class="w3-container">

    <p>Earth is generally forgiving to those who seek to change it. This, despite what we may want to believe, is not because it has a personality and cares about the well beings of the creatures inhabiting it. Instead, Earth tolerates change reasonably well because it hosts a complex web of life and physical systems which exhibit feedback mechanisms on each other. For example, if the population of one species suddenly grows rapidly, that species is likely to run out of food and eventually return to more typical levels. If ocean water is warmed in one area, currents will eventually move that water to cooler areas rather than allow it to continually heat up. If increased levels of carbon dioxide are released into the air, perhaps by volcanic activity or perhaps by cars' exhausts' pipes, the carbon dioxide is reasonably well dissipated throughout the atmosphere and absorbed by ocean waters. Plants and forests may also grow, taking up carbon dioxide, storing it and releasing oxygen.</p>

    <p>These feedback systems are not infallible though, and when they break, it can be dramatic. When a large asteroid impacted the earth some 66 million years ago, it was such a dramatic even that it temporarily broke many of the feedback mechanisms keeping the world stable. A dense covering of debris and ash is believed to have blanketed the atmosphere, limiting sunlight, stopping much plant growth and driving the earth into severe winter like conditions for many years. Earth eventually recovered, obviously, but not until nearly 75% of species on earth went extinct.</p>

    <p>While human activity is not impacting the Earth in such a dramatic way as did this asteroid 66 million years ago, it is disrupting many of the natural feedback mechanisms earth uses to maintain stable temperatures and other physical balances. The massive industrial excavation of carbon from underground in the form of coal, oil and gas, and the consequent releasing of it as carbon dioxide once it is burned, has started to take its toll on Earth's systems. As expected, the carbon dioxide has dispersed throughout the atmosphere, but more and more is introduced daily. The ocean has helped to buffer this increase by absorbing the gaseous carbon. As level increase though, this has also had the effect of making the oceans more acidic as the carbon dioxide dissociates into carbonic acid. The ocean too has its own buffers for such changes which have helped to slow this processes. Microscopic phytoplankton use the carbon dioxide in photosynthesis and many animals use the carbon in the water to create their shells. Still, as levels continue to rise, natural feedback mechanisms are unable to keep up. Ocean acidity is not responsible for bleaching coral reefs and accelerating the dissolution of some animals' shells.</p>

    <p>There are many signs beginning to emerge that we are stretching Earth about as far as it is willing to go before it simply snaps. By conducting activities like the burning of fossil fuels and cutting down much of Earth's natural vegetation at the same time, we are doing the equivalent of pushing someone while someone another person sits crouched behind their legs. By disrupting the Earth's processes on multiple fronts over long periods of time, we are simply not allowing the Earth's natural buffers enough time to re-stabilize. One such sign is the longterm warming of the atmosphere and oceans. This means that carbon dioxide, which allows heat from the sun to reach the earth but can prevent heat from reflecting back away from the earth, is knocking Earth's heat balance out of whack. While it is true the Earth goes through natural temperature cycles, which are largely in response to predictable astronomical cycles and responsible for glacial and interglacial periods, there is, to say the least, an uncanny correlation between human activities and changes in Earth's behavior. </p>

    <p>Because the Earth is so large and there are so many feedback systems buffering major changes, it has been slow to raise its fist, but it is important to understand that once certain systems break apart, they can take millions of years to put back together. One such system is that of ice. Over millions of years, water has evaporated from the oceans, formed clouds and been returned through precipitation. Some of that precipitation falls as snow which can accumulate for many many years on land. In addition to storing surprisingly large amounts of water on land, these large areas covered by snow and ice act to reflect the sun, much better than exposed land does. As we continue to release carbon dioxide, this ice will continue to melt which in turn causes more of the sun's energy to be absorbed, further warming the earth. This is an example of a positive feedback loop which, rather than slow change and maintain an equilibrium, can causes a run away effect where change accelerates over time. Just one reason we care about this is because a large majority of all people and trillions of dollars of infrastructure are located within a short distance of the coast. Melting land ice and a warming climate means sea levels will rise and large storms are likely to become more common and severe, further ravaging vulnerable coastal communities. </p>

    <p>We are picking on something that we live on, and that is a dangerous thing to do. It may not be conscious in the way we are, but we can already see it responding to our constant attacks. And, like it can be hard to tell exactly when or what pulls apart a person's last nerve before they snap, so it will be with the Earth, and the Earth's retaliation will be on a level commensurate with its size. So, the question is, are we really willing to risk testing the limits of the Earth before it snaps? </p>

        <h3><span class="w3-opacity">June 20, 2018:   </span> <b>The Trifecta (aka the beach)</b></h3>
        <h5>Just a few reasons why I'm weirdly obsessed with and study the coasts</h5>
      </div>
        <div class="w3-container">

    <p>I love the beach. And coasts in general. One of the neatest things about the coasts is their dynamicity. If you go to a beach one day and then a year later, it's unlikely it looks exactly the same. It may not even look the same from one day to the next if a strong storm hits. And this dynamic behavior is not limited to the visible section of the coast either. The shape of the bottom underneath the water can also also change continuously, something most surfers can attest to. A perfect sandbar won't be there forever</p>

    <p> And it is not just the land that changes; the ocean, this astonishingly massive pool of salty water, is most times covered by a complex array of ripples which, to us, can appear as powerful, magnificent and even destructive waves. And where do the waves come from but the final piece of the trifecta; the air moving over the liquid creates these waves which may then travel for hundreds or even thousands of miles before crashing into a coast.</p>

    <p> The coasts are the only places on earth where these three states of matter interact on such an immense scales. And while coasts may therefore receive the full furry of nature, they may also be one of the single most peaceful places to be. Almost everyone has walked up to a coastline at some point and just said, 'wow,' as most of their worries melt away. They are a place where, when nature turns her gentler side, we flock to for the sole purpose of being. Nowhere else do people come together and just sit in the glory of nature like they do on the coasts.</p>

        <h3><span class="w3-opacity">June 18, 2018:   </span> <b>Usurping Evolution</b></h3>
        <h5>Notes on the implications of understanding ourselves</h5>
      </div>
        <div class="w3-container">

    <p>It is an interesting point in time – at least for humans. We, collectively at a species, are the only known animal to have evolved in such a way that we have come to realize what biological evolution is, how it works and that it is the reason for our being here. It may seem an inconsequential and even philosophical consideration resulting from scientific inquiry, but to know how we came to be what we are may have some interesting implications. The strangeness of this knowledge, and what makes this such an interesting point in time for people, is that we are not limited to simply being aware of how evolution works. We can inspect it and asses it. Where evolution is limited to a single mind track – survive – we, though the processes of evolution, have come to a new era of awareness and prosperity. </p>  

    <p>Of course, a percentage of humans on this planet are not prospering. To many, the daily struggle for survival is all too real, and this is a genuine issue deserving of attention. As a whole though, our species is thriving. We have taken over the globe in such a way that no other animal poses any sort of threat to our species. We manipulate the earth to do as we will. We flattened it, plow it, and grow all the food we want, like no other animal ever has. We drain ancient pools of energy from deep underground to power machines that accelerate nearly all parts of our lives. We are gods, we think.</p>

    <p>But, also, we at times digress. For instance, if we have come to pick apart the very history that created us, mistake by mistake, why can we not yet command ourselves to discontinue the ongoing mistakes of evolution? One such mistake is our unwillingness to realize the commonality of our goals here on earth as humans, as people. In the great abundance of resources and knowledge we have gathered, why do we still fight over trivial matters? Why do some of us hoard food and goods for ourselves while others starve? </p>

    <p>We commit these mistakes and others because we have not yet come to fully believe in ourselves. We have obtained great power, but not yet accepted the responsibility that comes with it. Instead, we outsource the responsibility to good and evil, forces we believe to be innate and uncontrollable. Realistically though, is it not truly the lingering forces of evolution that prompt much that we believe to be evil? Good and evil, right and wrong – these things are recent creations that exist only within the minds of conscious beings. A weed in the earth may grow quickly, using up nutrients and quickly securing a spot in the sun before other plants have a chance to do the same, yet we know this behavior is an evolutionary tactic for survival, not greed. However, in our minds, we associate greed with poor morals, a characteristic we rarely link to evolution. </p>

    <p>People struggle, though, to realize the full potential of this new perspective we have been offered by our vast and growing understanding of the world around us. We have taken a step in the right direction, to (generally) label greed as a bad characteristic, but we rarely make a further and necessary connection; greed is an outdated evolutionary tactic for humans.</p>

    <p>In many ways, we continue to live like our only purpose is to survive, when really, survival is a given for most people in the developed world. We do not leave our houses in the morning thinking, ‘I hope I survive today.’ It’s a given. It is not, however, foolish or even wrong that evolution has left its mark on us. Evolution is a part of us. We are the products of it.</p>

    <p>But, we are now also something more. We are conscious in a new way, a way evolution never was. We can gather large sums of information, consider the past, present and future, and make informed decisions. And, because of this, we know world peace makes sense. We must therefore, actively, push back against evolution where it was wrong. We must say no to absurd behavior based on evolution. We must say yes to our great fortune we’ve been blessed with, our minds, and use it to create a new kind of evolution, one more aware and actively participating in the universe. </p>

      <h3><span class="w3-opacity">June 4, 2018:   </span> <b>Europe Trip: Days 1-3</b></h3>
      <h5>US (Kittery, ME to Boston, MA to Stewart Airport, New York), Norway, Spain and France. </h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
    <p> My girlfriend Kelly and I recently returned from a little European adventure. It was supposed to start with a flight out of Boston, MA heading directly to Barcelona, Spain. However... due to a little passport snafu, we ended up spending some 24 hours more in Boston -- much of it in a passport agency, but also some much more enjoyable time unexpectedly staying with our good and welcoming friend Adriana. While not exactly the first day of vacation I imagined, I was able to get a same day passport at the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/requirements/where-to-apply/passport-agencies/boston.html">Boston Passport Agency</a>. I've never had much of anything good to say about the process of getting a passport, but the people here were truly incredibly nice, understanding and helped save our trip when we really thought months of planning (and savings) was lost. Some 6 hours after first walking in, I walked out with a new passport.</p>

    <p>Of course, at this point we had long missed our original flight, so we scoured the interweb for any way to get to Barcelona that wouldn't entirely break the bank. What we found was a same day $300 some odd dollar flight to Barcelona with a stop over in Bergen, Norway. The catch? It left out of Stewart Airport in New York, a very small airport about 1.5 hours outside NYC, 3 hours drive from Boston and with no public transport to/from Boston where we were to fly back to 11 days later. We were somewhat desperate though and decided we'd figure out the whole car being in a different state thing later. We drove the 3 hours there, left the car in long term parking and just about 24 hours after we were originally supposed to depart, we were on a plain headed to Europe.</p>

    <p>We made it to our first stop, Bergen, Norway, with no issues and the view during the decent was enough to put Norway right near the top of my "To travel to" list.</p> <hr>
    <img src="BergenDecent.jpg" class="centerImage" alt="Decent into Bergen"  style="width:100%"><hr>

    <p>After a layover, we were back on a plane heading towards Barcelona. Our trip was back in sight and it already felt like ages since the Airline attendant said, "You are not going to be able to fly with this passport." Unfortunately, our late arrival to Barcelona meant we didn't have time to see the city. We raced across town to the train station where we immediately hopped on a train. After some train delays, pushing our total travel time up towards the 36 hour mark, we arrived in Avignon, France. After a killer shower and epic sleep, we finally (re)started our adventure. Avignon is a small and beautiful town in the South of France. It is perfectly sized such that it can be crossed by foot in about half an hour. This, however, does not mean there is little to see here. While we only had an evening and morning, I'm sure days could be spent exploring the perfectly French restaurants, cafes, and markets, as well as the stunning <i>Palais des Papes</i> and the famous <i>Pont Saint-Benezet</i> (or simply <i>Pont d'Avignon</i>).</p><hr>

    <img src="PonAvignon.jpg" class="centerImage" alt="Decent into Bergen" style="width:100%"><hr>

    <p>After running around the city, taking in all we could, we took a short train south to the much larger city of Marsellie, a port city of France located on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. Here we explored the <i>Basilique Notre-Dame de la Garde</i>, a beautiful pebble beach, the old forts of the city, the <i>Iles du Frioul</i> and many cafes with delicious croissants.</p><hr>
